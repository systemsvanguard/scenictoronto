# Scenic Toronto Tours - Flask Site

A small static site built with the Flask framework and Python 3 about a fictitous backpack Toronto tour site. Built to facilitate me uploading to DigitalOcean cloud account, while learning to configure, reverse proxy Nginx, and host multiple web sites from one DigitalOcean account. Live site and blog article to follow much later.
